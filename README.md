Tetravex game made in Java that can be played in command line.

TetraVex is an edge-matching puzzle. The player is presented with a grid (by default, 3x3) and nine square tiles, each with a number on each edge. The objective of the game is to place the tiles in the grid in the proper position. Two tiles can only be placed next to each other if the numbers on adjacent faces match.
